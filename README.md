# Pillar Dodge Project by Jake Potter

My Pillar Dodge program is a simple clone of flappy bird in C++. The goal is to dodge pillars and obtain the best score 
you can get.

You start on the start screen, where you can choose between three buttons for the difficulty. The harder the
choice the faster the pillars come at you. Using your mouse you have to dodge through each pillar to avoid contact.
When you hit a pillar the game ends and it tells you your final score in another screen. There you can press R to reset, and
it brings you back to the start.

This program uses screens, buttons, collision detection, mouse and keyboard inputs, and obviously the graphical aspect.
