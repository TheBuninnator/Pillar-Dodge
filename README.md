# Module 4 Open Ended Project by Jake Potter

My Pillar Dodge program is a simple clone of flappy bird. The goal is to dodge pillars and obtain the best score 
you can get.

You start on the start screen, where you can choose between three buttons for the difficulty. The harder the
choice the faster the pillars come at you. Using your mouse you have to dodge through each pillar to avoid contact.
When you hit a pillar the game ends and it tells you your final score in another screen. There you can press R to reset, and
it brings you back to the start.

This program uses screens, buttons, collision detection, mouse and keyboard inputs, and obviously the graphical aspect.

As of now there is one known 'bug'. When resetting the program I only cleared the pillars. All other objects are drawn on top of
their existing counterparts. You don't see it with the mountain or grass, but it does show in the clouds, which will increase to
infinity and beyond if nothing is done. I found that funny and as such elected to not change it.

With more time I would first improve the design style, which is fairly basic, but I prioritised functionality of glamour. 
Other steps I could make is having the game speed up as you progress, and perhaps shrink the holes you have to fit through as time 
goes on.    

All code is either written by me or Lisa Dion, as I used the Runner project as a jumping off point.

As for the grade, my code is well organized into different files, and the program seems very intuitive to me. I have made it interactive
in a variety of ways, with button shading and mouse and keyboard inputs. I used many of the modules concepts. I would score this a 90
having to take into account my rushed completion.
